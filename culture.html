<p>An important culture in Spain is music. The classic guitar was invented in Andalusia in the 1790s. In Mexico, the Charro outfit is seen as a national emblem and is a way to express pride in the Mexican Heritage. Costa Rica carries a label of their culture which is “Pura Vida” which means pure life. Lastly, Colombia reflects a lot in a colorful blend of Spanish and African, and indigenous influences.</p>
